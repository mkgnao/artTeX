% Synopsis: 	Bad italic correction when trace is loaded.
%
%   	Description of bug:
%
%   When the trace package is loaded, the italic correction is always
%   inserted at the end of \textit, even if followed by a in the
%   no-correction list.  This is due to the redefinition of \maybe@ic@
%   in the trace package, which uses the \@tempswa switch rather than
%   the \maybe@ic switch as in the kernel definition.  Later on,
%   \t@st@ic tests the switch \maybe@ic, not \@tempswa.
